We performed horizontal flip and rotation data augmentation methods.
We freezed the weights of all layers except the top 2 layers and retrained the model on the top 2 new layers.
Achieved training accuracy of 78% and validation accuracy of 86%.
Total number of layers in the base model is 155.
We then freezed the weights of all layers up until layer 120 and retrained the model on the remaining 35 layers.
Achieved training accuracy of 94% and validation accuracy of close to 100%.
